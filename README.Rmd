## Abstract

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species was created in to record information on extinction risk statuses for plants, animals, and fungi. It includes information about population sizes, threats, and ecology of each animal that is considered threatened. This project will serve to analyze the geographical distribution of mammals noted by the Red List as threatened or higher in status and determine if there is a significant trend in region of the world and extinction risk. The data set being used to determine this was collected from GBIF and is called the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The data will be taken and exploratory data analysis will be used to find equines that are listed on the Red List and then quantitatively summarize their geographic distribution in comparison to their extinction risk. By the end of this analysis a conclusion will be drawn about whether there is a significant correlation between geographic location and extinction risk.
